# Star Trek: Starship Commander

##Description

Ever since I was a small child I had an insatiable curiosity about the world: a need to explore and learn not only what was around me but how it worked and why it was there. So when my grandfather introduced to me a campy, low budget tv show named Star Trek, he introduced me to a relationship that would resonate with my very being, that would evolve into a life-long relationship that has been instrumental in who I have become. It wasn't the graphics and the acting that captured my passion and interest, but the very essence of the show. To explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before. It was a show based entirely on the very deepest reccesses of the foundation of my heart. To discover, to learn, to understand not only the world and those around us but ourselves. Later incarnations of the show continued and strengthened this bond between us. 

Programming incorporates so many of these aspects, that with it we can delve into the very essence of an aspect of our planet that is quickly defining us as a people and as a world... that is shaping our very future one line of code at a time. 

And so I present to you Star Trek: Starship Commander. In this game, you will experience first-hand what it is like to take the Captain's chair of your very own starship. Lead others as you explore those strange new worlds.. as you seek out new life and new civilizations with a completely customizable crew and attempt missions where no one has gone before.
